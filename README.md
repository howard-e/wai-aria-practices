# WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices

This repo prepares the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/) for integration into the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) website.

The WAI website is built in Jekyll and [brings together several git submodules
into one website](https://wai-website-theme.netlify.app/technical/).

This project implements a pipeline to convert the [aria-practices repo](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/), which
is currently a single static HTML file served by
[gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) and formatted and
post-processed with [ReSpec](https://pages.github.com/), into a multi-page static website to be served as a standalone resource on the
[wai-website](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/).
